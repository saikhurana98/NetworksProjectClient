In this class we will be working in theory\u2019s self-reflexive spirit: reading and writing about texts that think about reading and writing. Even though its antecedents stretch as far back as Plato, we will be focusing primarily on several schools of literary thought from the 19th\u00a0century to the present. The premise in all these theories is that literature is not a transparent medium; rather, we need to work hard in order to read, think, and write.\n\u00a0\n"

According to the seventeenth-century political theorist John Locke, our conception of public welfare had to expand beyond protecting and enforcing private transactions to conceptions of the common good, order, and access to roads and markets. Yet, as many of our greatest writers have noted, we only realize that our conceptions of justice have come to encompass public duties, health care, and infrastructure in moments of crises when roads fall into ruins and bodies succumb to pandemic. In this class, we come to these concepts through the literary tradition of the zone, which is an area of artificially supported trade and legality. The most recent example of the zone with which you may be familiar is the Green Zone in Iraq, but in actuality we are surrounded by \u201czones,\u201d from downtown Chicago and downtown New York to Guantanamo Bay, Rajiv Gandhi Educational City, as well as most maritime ports. We imagine zones into reality, and they become crossroads of trade, military force, finance, and communication. We will focus on literary depictions of the zone, which are organized around figures such as zombies, highwaymen, castaways, survivors, and human commodities whose freedom is traded away in free trade zones \u2013 such as slaves and indentured servants.\u00a0\u00a0Reading list includes\u00a0Zone One, One Flea Spare, Zoo City, A Journal of the Plague Year, The Female American, Jonathan Wilde, and The Corpse Washer.\u00a0\n"

This class covers fundamental algorithmic ideas that have had (and continue to have) a major influence on the evolution of computer science and several other disciplines, ranging from mathematics to biology to the social sciences.\nWe will be covering a vast array of techniques, starting from rudimentary divide & conquer and greedy algorithms to advanced dynamic programming. We shall also cover randomized algorithms of various types, streaming, continuous optimization, intractability, approximation, distributed algorithms, and many more. Throughout this process, we will be analyzing everything we do. This will (eventually) involve some usage of the central limit theorem (we'll be using the Markov and Chebyshev inequalities, which we will briefly cover in class), amortized analysis (which we will cover in detail), and some more probability theory (which will be covered as and when necessary).\nBecause of the conceptual nature of the material, just attending lectures and recitations and doing the homework are unlikely to be sufficient for learning all the concepts.\u00a0 Setting aside time to do the reading and to study your notes from lecture and recitation is generally necessary to truly learn and internalize the material, and to be able to apply it in new ways later in the course as well as for the rest of your life.\nHomework is essential for learning the material.\u00a0 Rather than thinking of problem sets as just a requirement, recognize them as an excellent means for learning the material, and for building upon it.\u00a0 Spread out the time you have to work the problems. Many people learn best by reading the problems long before they are due, and working on them over the course of a whole week; they find that their minds make progress working the problems in the background or during downtime throughout the day.\u00a0 Few people do their best learning the night before an assignment is due.\u00a0 Work with others if that is helpful, but with the goal of learning first and solving the problems second. It is worth reading the posted homework solutions, even if you received full credit.\u00a0 Often the clarity of explanation or details of implementation are different from the way you were thinking about things in ways that can improve your learning.\n"

Ontology is the subfield of metaphysics concerned with the study of what there is.\u00a0 It asks such questions as the following.\n--When are we committed to the existence of something?\n--Are there such things as Pegasus and Santa Claus?\nAbstract Entities.\u00a0Most take it for granted that ordinary concrete objects like chairs, mountains, and humans exist.\u00a0 But:\n--Do numbers exist?\n--Do universals (colors, shapes, etc.) exist?\nMaterial Objects.\n--Is it possible for two material objects to occupy the same place at the same time?\n--Are there really such things as chairs, mountains, and humans, or are there just fundamental particles arranged in various ways?\nTime and Time Travel.\n--Does time pass in the way that it seems to?/Is there a unique present?\n--Do the past and future exist?\n--Are temporal properties fundamentally tensed?\n--Is time travel possible?\nPersistence.\n--Do things survive change over time?\n--Are things wholly present at every moment at which they exist, or are they four-dimensional \"worms\"?\nFree Will.\n--Do we have free will?\n--Is free will possible in a deterministic universe?\n--Is free will possible in an indeterministic universe?\n"

We will start by understanding how single neurons can perform computations and can be understand in the same framework as electronic circuitry. We will understand then how complex information processing and calculation can happen as a result of the ways in which multiple neurons signal to and connect to one another. We will then look at how the brain is organized, and study the nervous systems of humans and other animals, approaching this through the lens of the various tools that neuroscientists have historically used to study neuronal connectivity and the brain. We will cover the electrical properties of nerve cells and voltage dependent membrane permeability; channels, transporters, neurotransmitters and their receptors; synaptic transmission; the brain and its development and plasticity. We will also study complex brain functions and the neural basis of complex cognition, learning and information processing. We explore the ways in which the neuronal processes underlying behaviour have been deduced from various animal models of behaviour, and ways in which genetics and the environment shape the systems that produce behaviour during development. We will explore sensory perception and motor movement in depth.\n\u00a0\nIn order to equip students to become familiar with the level of rigour needed to think through some of these questions, we will also look at how to survey and evaluate literature in the field of biological psychology, how to quickly but accurately read graphs and how to cite literature.\n\u00a0\nWe then turn to the question of how we learn, how we absorb new material, the ways in which our neural systems tend to conflate correlation and causation, and how critical thinking and environmental training can change learning patterns and feedback to change the structure of the brain. We will take a quick look at the neural basis of complex and interesting phenomena such as motivation, emotion, cognition, consciousness, attention. We will end with an exploration of how neural systems can exhibit pathology, how neurodegeneration and trauma can impact the system, and how medication and drugs work, with a focus on the limitations of what we collectively understand and the pressing need for further research to take forward the field. This course eventually hopes to make clear the relationship between brain and behaviour.\n"

The course will be an integrated whole and seek to develop a nuanced view of the transitions, contests and transformation in polity and society from the provincial elections of 1937 till the general elections of 1977 and the first democrartic transfer of office in independent India at the federal level.\n\r\nThe course looks at the relation of political social and changes in\u00a0India\u00a0correlating\u00a0internal and external developments. it commences with the victory of the Congress in the provincial polls and concludes with its rout in the\u00a01977\u00a0Lok Sabha polls. Among the issues examined are World War II and\u00a0India, for instance its relation to Partition. The changing equations of regions and the emerging nation state, the making of the linguistic states and the rise of economic planning and its early crises. The Congress and its critics get attention as do the debates on environment, technology and science.\u00a0\n\r\nThe course correlates and locates these changes in a wider context: the end of empire and decolonization;\u00a0\u00a0the Cold War and Sino Soviet split in Asia, and their relation to South\u00a0Asia. Often as in the case of the wars of 1947 or 1962 or 1971 these conflicts had important domestic political implications as well.\u00a0 \u00a0The\u00a0 transfromation of the Indian economy under planning and the criris end 1960s too cast a shadow .India's emergence as a regional power by the end of the 1971 war and the 1974 explosion at Pokhran had elements of both change and continuity with the past.\r\nSo the course spans history, politics and international relations and encourages informed and critical thinking on an exciting period of the recent past. The fabled 'Congress system' was in crisis by 1967 and the party and polity remade by Mrs Gandhi soon thereafter by 1971-72. The aftermath of 1972-73 led to serious challenges and the Emergency of 1975-77. The course also pays considerbale attention ot regional histopries including the south and North East.\r\n\u00a0\n"

Some of these questions are easier than others, but all of them require engaging in ethical analysis. This course is about that sort of thing.\n\u00a0\nWe will begin by reading three key works in the history of Western ethics. These books will introduce us to three important ethical theories: virtue ethics, deontological ethics, and utilitarianism. We'll read Aristotle's\u00a0Nicomachean Ethics, Kant's\u00a0Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, and Mill's\u00a0Utilitarianism. The rest of the topics will be chosen by your votes. We will read a mixture of metaethics (theoretical questions about ethics), normative ethics (detailed theories of right and wrong), and applied ethics (specific practical ethical questions).\n\u00a0\nWhile the course is taught online, it will be asynchronous with an optional synchronous component. This means you will not be required to attend course meetings, but I will hold meetings during class time, which will consist of things like Q&As. These meetings will be recorded.\n"

Right from its inception, with Dadasaheb Phalke\u2019s Raja Harishchandra (1913), it has shaped the public narrative in India.\nWhile the themes of Hindi films have changed over the years -- from the patriotic Mother India to the sports-feminist Dangal, the presentation of nationalism, sports and sexualities may just be old wine in new bottles. We will examine these ideologies primarily through the lens of gender\nWe will also explore how the language, fashion, music, dance, and social values embedded in Bollywood films are disseminated. International theoretical readings from ideas of nationalism, film, gender, class, and cultural studies, and literature from various parts of the world will underpin our discussions of Bombay\u2019s film industry and our exploration of the values and ideologies embedded in apparently innocent entertainment.\nOne of the course\u2019s goals is to recognize these themes and develop the analytical tools to effectively \u201cread\u201d a text/film, empowering us to identify challenge mainstream norms.\n"

In this discussion-oriented interactive course, we will read and review children\u2019s books, examine the purposes of visual literacy, and write reviews on specific authors and illustrators.\nThis course aims to examine how the books children read \u2013 from Aesop\u2019s Fables to Amar Chitra Katha comics and the Harry Potter series \u2013 shape their outlook and emotional development. We will study the historical, creative, nurturing, emotional, and educational aspects of these forms of literature and their impact on us later in life. We will also consider why a study of children\u2019s literature is important, and how it impacts pedagogies for children across borders.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will also examine the views of multiple theoretical thinkers and texts in conjunction with actual children's literature.

At the same time, we will also study theoretical thinkers such as Jack Zipes, Seth Lerer, Paulo Freire, and Bruno Bettelheim to help us navigate the complex field of children\u2019s literature in relation to issues of culture, religion, difference, gender, and sexuality.\nWe will unpack the didactic intent as well as the pleasure principle that might have prompted the writers. Authorial intent is, however, only one part of our study; the other part is to see how children and parents receive these stories. Children\u2019s literature creates moral as well as national frameworks that help acculturate young people. In examining the genre of children\u2019s literature, we will consider various sub-genres such as picture books, fairy tales, fables, and chapter books.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"

        "desc": "Courses in law & literature tend to focus primarily (often exclusively) on literary texts. My view is that literature can be more productively studied when literary and legal materials are placed next to each other. This approach does not treat law as the taken-for-granted backdrop that students already know, but instead makes explicit the similarities and differences between the two areas. What you have already learned about the law in other classes (no prerequisites required!) is not inevitably alien to the qualities of literary writing and analysis. In that way, the course is designed to show how legal modes of thought are sometimes already present in literary texts and vice versa. To that end, my syllabus combines literary readings, literary criticism, judicial opinions, and legal scholarship. Questions we will ask: How does literature use or respond to legal structures, themes, and analytical techniques, and vice versa?\u00a0 How does literature portray legal institutions and processes?\u00a0 What can literature bring to the performance of legal tasks, including legal narrative?\u00a0To what extent can literary critical accounts of narrative structure and coherence explain the role of narrative in law, and where do these accounts fall short?\u00a0What is achieved and what is missed by positing literature as law\u2019s \u201cother\u201d (e.g., as the imaginative and ethical alternative to legal rules and constraints)?\u00a0 We will take up various problems at the intersection of law and literature: legal fictions, forms of legal writing and explanation, and the regulation of literature through copyright law. Next we will focus on two legal problems that have also occupied literary thinkers: the problem of criminal responsibility and literature\u2019s ability to document human thought and motives, and the question of privacy in criminal law, tort law, and fiction. Afterwards, we will explore the concept of jurisdiction, terra nullius, and crown land. We will end by considering possible future directions for law and literature.\u00a0\u00a0Reading list includes\u00a0Dorian Gray,\u00a0The Importance of Being Earnest,\u00a0Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Round House, and\u00a0The House of the Vampire.\n"

On the one hand, the experience of the industrial megacity is both a topic of and inspiration for some of the formal innovations associated with the historical avant garde. But to equate the \"urban\" with the \"modern\" is itself a kind of provincialism. Ostensibly \"rural\" places do not fall outside of history because of the concentration of economic and political power in cities, but moreover, many countrysides often bear the marks of their integration into global relations of production, relations visible in the landscape if one knows where and how to look. Not only are phenomena such as pollution and urban sprawl ways in which industrial production is inscribed on the landscape, but the ideological divide between urban and rural itself shapes the way in which these spaces are perceived. With that in mind, in this course we will encounter texts that think through the city/country divide. We will read fictional texts from a variety of traditions by authors such as Thomas Hardy, Ishimure Michiko, Arun Kolatkar, and W.G. Sebald and theoretical texts by authors such as Karl Marx, Raymond Williams, Theodor Adorno, and Mike Davis.\n"

However, since the formation of the discipline, a lot of work has been done by translators and academics to push the envelope as to the politics this transfer of meaning might entail.\u00a0Translation\u00a0is not an innocuous linguistic act, but rife with power politics. This course aims to push its students towards thinking of\u00a0translation\u00a0as not simple a transfer of meaning, but an embodying of difference. It will attempt to inculcate in students a method reading that grounds itself in the politics of language. Furthermore, it will allow for students to look towards and embrace non-linguistics acts of\u00a0translation\u00a0as well. By the end of the course, students should be able to look beyond the readings prescribed on the various facets of\u00a0translation\u00a0and gather an understanding of not just what\u00a0translation\u00a0entails, but what it leaves out.\n"
